<h2 align="center">0x1D. C - Binary trees</h2>
<p align="center"> At the end of this project, you will learn what is a binary tree and its types, what are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree, the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree, what are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree and what is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
